I am a masterâ€™s student in Mathematics at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. <a href='https://ernestryu.com/'>Ernest K. Ryu</a>.

I am interested in everything at the intersection of artificial intelligence, logic, and mathematics. Currently I am working on how approaches from neural theorem proving, large language models and multi-modal intelligence can come together to enhance mathematical reasoning.
