I am a masterâ€™s student in Mathematics at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. <a href='https://ernestryu.com/'>Ernest K. Ryu</a>.

My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, logic, and mathematics, focusing on how neural theorem proving, large language models, and formal methods can come together to transform the practice of mathematical research and reasoning.
